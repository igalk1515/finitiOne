## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project locally. Unfortunately, I was unable to provide a Docker setup due to network issues. I appreciate your understanding, and I made the process as simple as possible!

### Prerequisites

- Composer
- Node.js and npm
- A database system (MySQL, SQLite, etc.)

### Server Setup

1. **Navigate to the Server Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/server

   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan serve
   ```

### Server Setup

2. **Navigate to the Client Directory**:
